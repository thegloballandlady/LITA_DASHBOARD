# REPORT ON DATA ANALYSIS CLASS-LITA PROGRAM
---

### Overview
---
This project involved analyzing a dataset called Class Inventory Data, which included columns such as revenue, market, sales categories, line of business, and models. Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides insights into revenue trends, market performance, and sales distribution across different business lines and models. This README highlights the key objectives, methods, and findings from the analysis.

### Project Objectives
---

The main objectives for this analysis were: 
1. To analyze and interpret revenue trends across different markets.
2. To evaluate the performance of various sales categories.
3. To identify which lines of business and models contributed most to overall revenue.


### Data Analysis and Visualization in Power BI
---
Using Power BI, I developed several visualizations to explore patterns and trends within the data. Key visualizations included:
1. Revenue Breakdown by Market: Visualized revenue distribution across various markets, highlighting the most profitable regions.
2. Sales Categories Analysis: Showed the share of each sales category to understand customer preferences and demand patterns.
3. Line of Business Performance: Analyzed revenue contributions from each line of business, identifying top performers.
4. Model-Based Insights: Compared models to find out which products had the highest sales and revenue impact.


### Key Metrics
---

Total Revenue: Summed revenue across all categories and markets.
Revenue by Market: Calculated revenue per market to identify high-earning regions.
Sales Category Contribution: Measured each category's contribution to total sales.
Top Models: Listed models that generated the highest sales.

### Key Findings
---

1. Revenue Leaders: Certain markets consistently showed higher revenue, indicating strong regional performance.
2. Category Insights: Sales categories displayed varying levels of demand, with some showing growth potential.
3. Top Business Lines: Some business lines outperformed others, contributing significantly to overall revenue.
4. High-Impact Models: A few models consistently led in revenue generation, suggesting popular product lines.


### Power BI Dashboard
---

The Power BI dashboard developed for this project enables interactive exploration of the data, with filters for each variable. This allows users to view revenue trends, compare sales categories, and analyze line of business performance in real-time.

Data Source
The Class Inventory Data dataset was provided by the LITA program and represents a sample of inventory and sales data for analytical practice.
