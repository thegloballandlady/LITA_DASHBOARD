# MY DATA ANALYSIS PROGRESS REPORT - LITA PROGRAM
---

### Overview
---

After over 9 weeks in the LITA data analysis program, I have developed hands-on skills in Excel, SQL, and Power BI ðŸ˜„, with a focus on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. This report summarizes the core competencies I have gained, with details on each tool's applications and highlights of the learning experience.



### Excel Skills
---
In Excel, I have achieved proficiency in various data analysis techniques that form the backbone of clean and interpretable data. Key skills include:
1. Data Cleaning: Ensuring accuracy and consistency by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.
2. Conditional Formatting: Highlighting patterns and trends using color-coding and rules for quick insights.
3. VLOOKUP: Linking data across sheets to bring together relevant information for analysis.
4. Pivot Tables: Summarizing and aggregating large data sets to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
-- Additional Functions: Expanding my toolkit with formulas to streamline and automate data handling tasks.


### SQL Skills
---
With SQL, I developed the ability to query and manipulate databases efficiently. Major skills acquired include:
1. Table Management: Creating and dropping tables for organized data structuring.
2. WHERE Statements: Filtering data based on criteria for targeted analysis.
3. Joins: Merging multiple tables to create unified datasets.
4. Unions and Subqueries: Using advanced techniques to manage and retrieve data.
5. Window Functions: Performing complex calculations across data sets without changing underlying data structures.


### Power BI Skills
---
In Power BI, I learned how to transform raw data into meaningful visuals, facilitating clear communication of insights. Key Power BI skills include:
1. Data Relationships: Setting up and managing relationships between tables for comprehensive analysis.
2. DAX Functions: Leveraging advanced formulas to drive in-depth data analysis.
3. Drill Down and Power Query: Transforming and drilling into data for hierarchical insights.
4. Conditional Formatting and Binning: Enhancing data clarity and grouping values into meaningful categories.
5. Data Visualization: Crafting visuals like charts and dashboards to tell a story and uncover trends in the data.


### Data Visualization
---
Skills in data visualization include:
Designing interactive dashboards and reports to communicate findings.
Using diverse visual elements such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts to highlight trends and support decision-making.
Employing best practices in design for clarity and impact, ensuring data insights are accessible and easy to understand.
