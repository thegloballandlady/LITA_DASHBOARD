### BECOMING A DATA ANALYST: MY STORY CONTINUES
---
Its been over 9 amazing week since i started my journey as a data analyst with LITA and it has been exhilirating learning so much and being to do so much on Excel


### WHAT I HAVE ACHIEVED THIS FAR 
---
I am now able to do the following: 
On Excel (data cleaning, conditional formatting, vlookup,pivot tables and much more)
SQL (Create tables, Drop tables, Where statement, Unions, Joins, Subquerries, Window functions and a lot more)
Power BI ( Creating and managing relationships, DAX function, Drill down, Power query, Conditional formatting, Bin & list, Data visualization, etc...)


### TOOLS I USE IN DATA ANALYSIS
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
 
    
- SQL- Structured Query Language for Querying of Data

  
- Github for Portfolio Building


### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
---
Here, we take the following actions: 
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting


### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
---
A statistical approach to understanding and summarizing dataset . This different methods helps:
1. To identify patterns and relationships
2. Understand data distribution and variability
3. Develop hypotheses for further investigation



### DATA ANALYSIS
---
These are some basic codes used while working on SQL
``` SQL
- SELECT*
  FROM employee_demographics (you use any table based on its name )
- STRING FUNCTIONS
- SUBQUERIES
- CASE STATEMENT
