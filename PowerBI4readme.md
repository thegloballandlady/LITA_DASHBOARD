# REPORT ON HR DATASET - LITA PROGRAM
---


### Overview
---
This project focused on analyzing an HR dataset, providing insights into employee demographics, attrition trends, and other key metrics that support data-driven decision-making in human resources. The dataset included fields such as attrition, employee numbers, education field, gender, department, revenue, and marital status. Additionally, we created various measures and visualizations to explore the data more deeply.



### Key Measures and Calculations
---
Several essential measures were calculated to enhance our understanding of the dataset:
1. Attrition Rate: Calculated to assess the percentage of employees leaving the organization over time.
2. Total Number of Attrition: Sum of employees who left, providing an overview of turnover.
3. Average Date of Birth: Used to derive insights on age distribution.
4. Average Age of Total Employees: Determined to gain a better understanding of the workforce's age structure.



### Custom Column - Age Band
---
A custom Age Band column was created to group employees into categories:

Under 25
25-34
35-44
45-54
Over 55
This categorization allowed us to analyze trends based on age and to understand attrition patterns and employee distribution across age groups.



### Data Visualization
---
Using Power BI, we created dashboards to visualize the HR data effectively. Key visualizations included:
1. Attrition by Department: Showed which departments experienced the highest attrition rates.
2. Revenue and Attrition Correlation: Analyzed potential relationships between revenue contribution and attrition.
3. Employee Distribution by Age Band: Illustrated the age composition of the workforce.
4. Gender and Marital Status Analysis: Provided insights into demographics and social factors influencing employee profiles.
These visualizations enabled interactive exploration, with filters and drill-downs to view data by specific demographics or departments.
