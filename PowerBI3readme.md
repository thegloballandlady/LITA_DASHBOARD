# DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION REPORT - LITA PROGRAM
---

### Overview
---
Data cleaning and transformation are critical steps in preparing raw data for analysis. 
This module emphasized the importance of trimming and restructuring data, ensuring accuracy and usability in analytical workflows. 
Learning these skills has been both rewarding and essential to improving data quality.


### Data Cleaning
---
Data trimming was an integral part of the cleaning process. This involved:
1. Removing Extra Spaces: Enhancing data consistency by trimming unnecessary spaces.
2. Standardizing Letter Cases: Ensuring uniform text format for seamless data handling.
3. Merging and Splitting: Using functions like Concatenate to combine columns and Text to Columns to split data, making it cleaner and more structured.
4. Trimming improved data quality, making it ready for visualization and transformation.



### Data Transformation
---
The transformation stage involved restructuring data to suit analysis needs. Key steps included:
1. Data Structuring: Organizing data into relevant columns for streamlined analysis.
2. Formatting and Calculations: Applying functions to create calculated fields and standardized formats.
3. Filtering and Categorizing: Sorting and grouping data for specific insights, making it easier to visualize trends and patterns.
