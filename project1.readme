### BECOMING A DATA ANALYST: MY STORY CONTINUES
---
Its been over 9 amazing week since i started my journey as a data analyst with LITA and it has been exhilirating learning so much and being to do so much on Excel(data cleaning, conditional formatting, vlookup,pivot tables and much more


### HOW DO I WANT TO ACHIEVE THIS 
---
Working diligently is said to make one sit before kings and not mean me, i believee that's my goal to give myself to continious learning, be determined, put in the extra work, overcome my fears and become better and brighter. 
I know it might look childish to make a wish but i wish to be an outstanding data analyst, one with a difference not just in words but deeds. To stand out and to never tell myseelf it isn't possible or it isn't meant to be.
I know all things are possible to them that believe as well as work smart.
